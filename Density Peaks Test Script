#' The set of random data generated for testing was written using 
#' code that my teacher wrote. Everything else is my own code.
#' This code was not written for a homework assignment.
#' It was written due to a personal communication with my teacher
#' as an optional assignment. The densePeakFunction was the product of
#' this and is included in a separate file of this repository.

# The following removes everything but tVC
## `rm` removes and `ls` lists the objects currently loaded
rm(list = ls())

# Create randomized test data
set.seed(11)
testData <- c(
  rnorm(n = 50000,mean = 10.5  ,sd = 5),

  rnorm(n =  1000,mean = 10.5*3,sd = 5),
